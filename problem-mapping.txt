so i need to figure out whether i am going to figure this out.

basically i need a list that is an object that contains a list of objects.

each object is a task. each task should have a completed/not completed

when you click on a new list, a function should loop through the list of tasks and publish 
them to the dom correctly

it might be useful to create a pub/sub model -- i sort of already have the bones.

when a user adds a new list, a new list object will be created.

when the value of the DOM matches the value of a list, a task that is added will be
pushed to that corresponding list

the list tab needs to correspond with a data-id of some kind.

the list tab buttons need to correspond with the data-id of the list tab
